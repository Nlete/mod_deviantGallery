mod_deviantGallery
==================

A simple module to include DeviantART gallery to your Joomla 3.x page. Just donwload the release, install at the Extension Manager, and set it up. Be sure to set up the Deviant username and the gallery(if you want a specific one), otherwise, it will not show your arts!
Big thank you for the DeviantART API for:
